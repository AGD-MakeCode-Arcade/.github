Accidental Game Dev MakeCode Arcade
===================================

This org contains repos of backups from MicroSoft's MakeCode Arcade (https://arcade.makecode.com/) 
that I've been using to teach my young niece (10yrs old at the time of writing) the basic of game logic. 
 
Please see the individual repos for credits of any free assets that I have used.
